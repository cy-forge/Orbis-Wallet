# Contributing to Orbis Wallet

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Orbis Wallet! We
appreciate your help in making this project better. This guide outlines the
basic steps for contributing.

## How to Contribute

Orbis Wallet uses OnlyDust to manage contributions. Here's the
process:

1. **Find an Issue:** Browse the open issues on our OnlyDust page
   [Orbis Wallet](https://app.onlydust.com/projects/orbis-wallet/overview).
   Look for issues labeled "good first issue" if you're new to the project, or
   other issues that interest you.

2. **Apply for the Issue:** If you'd like to work on an issue, click the "Apply"
   button on the OnlyDust issue page. This lets us know you're interested.

3. **Issue Assignment:** A project maintainer will review your application. If
   you're selected, the issue will be assigned to you on OnlyDust.

4. **Fork the Repository:** Fork the Orbis Wallet repository on GitHub
   to your own GitHub account.

5. **Create a Branch:** Create a new branch for your work. Use a descriptive
   branch name, like `feat/new-feature` or `fix/bug-fix`.

6. **Make Your Changes:** Make the necessary changes to the code. Follow the
   project's coding style and conventions. Be sure to test your changes
   thoroughly.

7. **Commit Your Changes:** Commit your changes with clear and concise commit
   messages. Use the present tense (e.g., "Add new feature" instead of "Added
   new feature").

8. **Create a Pull Request (PR):** Push your branch to your forked repository on
   GitHub. Then, create a pull request from your branch to the main branch of
   the Orbis Wallet repository.

9. **PR Review:** A project maintainer will review your PR. They may request
   changes or provide feedback. Address any comments and push updated code to
   your branch.

10. **Merge:** Once the review is complete and the PR is approved, a maintainer
    will merge your changes into the main branch.

## Coding Style

Please follow the existing coding style and conventions used in the project.
Consistency is important for maintainability. If there are specific linting or
formatting tools used, make sure to configure them in your development
environment.

## Testing

Ensure that your changes are well-tested. Write unit tests or integration tests
as appropriate to cover your changes. Provide clear instructions on how to run
the tests.

## Documentation

If your contribution adds or modifies functionality, update the relevant
documentation (e.g., the README, developer guides) to reflect the changes.
